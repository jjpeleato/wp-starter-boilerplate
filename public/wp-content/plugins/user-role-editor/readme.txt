== Changelog =

= [4.52.1] 11.11.2019 =
* Update: URE requires PHP version 5.6.
* ure_cpt_editor_roles filter was added. It takes 2 parameters: array $roles with 1 element 'administrator' by default and $post_type with post type name string. Add other role(s) to which you wish automatically add all user capabilities for custom post type $post_type. URE updates roles this way before opening "Users->User Role Editor" page.
* New user capability 'ure_nav_menus_access' was added. It's used at the User Role Editor Pro only.

= [4.52] 07.10.2019 =
* New:  Multisite: WordPress (tested up to version 5.2.3) shows "Change role to..." drop-down list at "Network Admin->Sites->selected site->Users tab" with roles filled from the main site, but should use roles list from the selected site. URE replaces this roles list with roles from the selected site and excludes error with message "Sorry, you are not allowed to give users that role.", when you try to grant to a user a role from the main site, which does not exist at the selected site.
