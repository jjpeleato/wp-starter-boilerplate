SuperPWA helps you convert your WordPress website into a Progressive Web App instantly.

== Description ==

> **Help decide on the future of SuperPWA**
> We are looking for your input to decide on the future of SuperPWA. If you wish to acquire SuperPWA as a whole and continue it's development or if you are interested in a premium version of the plugin with extended features, [please fill in the form and let us know](https://superpwa.com/superpwa-2-1/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=description-future). 

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) is a new technology that combines the best of mobile web and the best of mobile apps to create a superior mobile web experience. They are installed on the phone like a normal app (web app) and can be accessed from the home screen. 

Users can come back to your website by launching the app from their home screen and interact with your website through an app-like interface. Your return visitors will experience almost-instant loading times and enjoy the great performance benefits of your PWA!

Super Progressive Web Apps makes it easy for you to convert your WordPress website into a Progressive Web App instantly!

Once SuperPWA is installed, users browsing your website from a supported mobile device will see a "Add To Home Screen" notice (from the bottom of the screen) and will be able to 'install your website' on the home screen of their device. Every page visited is stored locally on their device and will be available to read even when they are offline!

SuperPWA is easy to configure, it takes less than a minute to set-up your Progressive Web App! SuperPWA does a clean uninstall, by removing every database entry and file that it creates. In fact, none of the default settings are saved to the database until you manually save it the first time. Go ahead and give it a try.

And the best part? If you ever get stuck, we are here to watch your back! [Open a support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/super-progressive-web-apps) ticket if you have a question or need a feature. We are super excited to hear your feedback and we want to genuinely help you build the best Progressive Web App for your WordPress website!

#### Quick Demo? 

* Open up [SuperPWA.com](https://superpwa.com/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=description-demo) in a supported device. 
* Add the website to your home screen either from the Add to Home Screen prompt (Chrome for Android) or from the browser menu. 
* Open the app from your home screen and you will see the splash screen. 
* Turn off your data and wifi to go offline and open up the app. You will still be able to see the app and browse the pages you have already visited. 
* Browse to a page that you haven't visited before. The offline page will be displayed. 

#### Thank You PWA Enthusiasts! 

We are humbled by the feedback from the community. Thanks to everyone who believed in us and tried our plugin. Your feedback has been invaluable and we have learned a lot from your experience. Thank you for your love and support and we hope to return the love by striving to bring you the best ever Progressive Web Apps plugin for WordPress!

### Progressive Web App Minimum Requirements

Progressive Web Apps require that your WordPress website is served from a secure origin i.e. your website should be HTTPS and not HTTP. If your website isn't HTTPS, please contact your host about it. You can also [ask us](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/super-progressive-web-apps) if you need help.

### Device and Browser Support For PWA

Progressive web apps need browsers that support manifests and service workers. Currently Google Chrome (version 57+), Chrome for Android (62), Mozilla Firefox (57), Firefox for Android (58) are the major browsers that support PWA. 

The list is fast growing and is likely to be supported in most major browsers by the end of this year.

### How To Convert Your WordPress Website Into A Progressive Web App

#### WordPress Installation

* Visit WordPress Admin > Plugins > Add New
* Search for 'Super Progressive Web Apps'
* Click "Install Now" and then "Activate" Super Progressive Web Apps

To install manually:

* Upload super-progressive-web-apps folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory on your server
* Go to WordPress Admin > Plugins
* Activate Super Progressive Web Apps plugin from the list.

#### Customizing Your Progressive Web App

Your Progressive Web App should be ready to test with the default settings on activation. You can customize it further and make it truly your own.

* Go to WordPress Admin > SuperPWA
* Set a Background Color for the splash screen to be shown when your PWA is opened on a mobile device.
* Set the Application Icon. This will be the icon of your PWA when it is added to the homescreen in a mobile device. The icon must be a PNG image and exactly 192 x 192 pixels in size.
* Set the Offline Page. This page will be displayed if the user is offline and the page he requested is not cached already. Ideally you should create a dedicated WordPress page and set it here. Within the page you create, you could add a note that reads, "It looks like you are offline and the page you requested is not available right now. Please check back again once you are online.". 
* Click "Save Settings".

#### Testing Your Progressive Web App

* Open a supported browser in a supported device (for eg: Chrome for Android (62 or higher) in an Android Phone)
* Enter your website and wait till it fully loads
* You should see a pop-up that has your Application Icon and a button that reads "ADD TO HOME SCREEN".
* Click on it and your PWA will be added to your home screen. Wait for the install to complete. 
* Go to your home screen and open your PWA. Browse into a few pages if you like. Close the App.
* Disconnect from the internet and now open your PWA again. You should be able to see all the pages that you previously browsed. 
* Try visiting a page that you did not visit before. You should see the page you set as your "Offline Page" in the settings of SuperPWA. 

#### Troubleshooting Your Progressive Web App

Uh, oh. Your PWA did not work as expected? You do not see the "Add to Home Screen" notice?

* Make sure your website has a SSL certificate installed. i.e. your website should be https instead of http (as in https://your-domain.com).
* Make sure you are using a supported device and a supported browser. Refer to the "Device and Browser Support For PWA" list above.
* Make sure your Application Icon and Splash Screen Icon's are of PNG format and 192px X 192px and 512px X 512px in size respectively. 
* Clear the browser cache and try again. In Chrome for Android, go to Settings > Privacy > "Clear browsing data".
* If the application icon does not update after first install, delete the PWA from your phone, clear browser cache and install again. (We are working on making it better.) 
* Create a [new support ticket](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/super-progressive-web-apps) and share a link to your website. We will take a look and figure it out for you.

### Feature Requests, Issues, Pull Requests

Here is our repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/SuperPWA/Super-Progressive-Web-Apps). Send us your pull requests, feature requests or issues, if any.

### About us

We are a duo who got excited about the idea. Our mission is simple: Help you build an awesome PWA that your users would want to have on their home screen.

When we first heard about PWA we wanted to learn everything about it. We have spent countless hours learning and wants to share it with the world. 

Please give us your constructive feedback and support. 

== Installation ==

To install this plugin:

1. Install the plugin through the WordPress admin interface, or upload the plugin folder to /wp-content/plugins/ using FTP.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress. 
3. Go to WordPress Admin > SuperPWA

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

If you have any questions, please ask it on the [support forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/super-progressive-web-apps).

= Will Progressive Web Apps work on iOS devices? =

Starting with Safari for iOS 11.3, Apple devices offer partial support for PWA's. However, there is no native Add To Home Screen prompt just yet. You can add your app by tapping "Add to Home Screen" button in the share menu of the browser ( look for the square icon with an up arrow in the foreground ).

Just like you, we are eagerly awaiting the upcoming releases and we hope to see better compatibility in the coming months. 

= How To Customize Splash Screen = 

You can easily change the icon and the background color in SuperPWA > Settings. 

Further customizations are not available right now, not because of any limitation of SuperPWA, but because they are not available in the PWA technology. When more options come up in the future, we will add them to SuperPWA then. 

= How To Track Visits Originating From Your Progressive Web App = 

You can track visits from your PWA in your analytics software (for e.g. Google Analytics) using the UTM Tracking add-on of SuperPWA. Go to SuperPWA > Add-Ons and activate UTM Tracking. Then in SuperPWA > UTM Tracking, you can set the UTM parameters as needed. Please [refer the documentation](https://superpwa.com/addons/utm-tracking/?utm_source=wordpress.org&utm_medium=description-faq) for further information. 

= GDPR Compliance =

SuperPWA does not collect or store user data, nor does it set cookies or store tracking data. Content visited by users from your PWA is stored in the user's own device, in the cache of the browser. This is very similar to how modern browsers caches content offline for faster browsing. 

With the UTM Tracking Add-On, you will be able to differentiate the visits originating from your PWA in your analytics software. You may have to include this in your privacy policy. Please note that SuperPWA does not track the visits, we just help you add the UTM parameters to the URL of the Start Page of your app so that third party analytics tools can differentiate the visits. 

Feel free to get in touch if you have any questions.
