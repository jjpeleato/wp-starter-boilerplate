= Don't risk your backups on anything less =

Your WordPress backups are worth the entire investment you've made in your website. The day may come when you get hacked, when something goes wrong with an update, your server crashes or your hosting company goes bust - without good backups, you lose everything. Would you entrust all your hard work to a backup plugin with only a few thousand downloads, mixed reviews or no professional support?

Believe us: writing a reliable backup plugin that works consistently across the huge range of WordPress deployments is hard.

UpdraftPlus works. We'll keep your backups safe.

= Why you should backup your website. =

WordPress like any CMS can be vulnerable to things such as server crashes, hacking, security flaws, bad plugin or theme updates and insecure web hosts. If anything happened to your website, it would cost you dearly in time, money and reputation.

Whilst other security measures are essential, backups are the ultimate insurance: they mean that, if the worst were to happen, your website (plus all related files and databases) stay safe, and can be restored in no time.

You could always create your own manual backups- but using backup plugin is infinitely quicker, simpler and safer. Life's busy enough! With UpdraftPlus, you can simply "set and forget", scheduling in automatic backups to save you time, work and hassle.

= How UpdraftPlus compares with other backup plugins: =

UpdraftPlus is the most highly-rated and popular plugin out there - and for good reason. Not only is it comprehensive in terms of its features, but it's also easy and intuitive to use.

Unlike many other plugins, UpdraftPlus:

* Restores, as well as backing up
* Backs up to more cloud options than any others
* Allows you to set up automatic backup schedules, for the ultimate in convenience

= Are you multi-lingual? Can you translate? =

Are you able to translate UpdraftPlus into another language? Are you ready to help speakers of your language? UpdraftPlus Backup/Restore itself is ready and waiting - the only work needed is the translating. The translation process is easy, and web-based - go here for instructions: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/translate/">https://updraftplus.com/translate/</a>. (Or if you're an expert WordPress translator already, then just pick out the .pot file from the wp-content/plugins/updraftplus/languages/ directory - if you scan for translatable strings manually, then you need to get these functions: _x(), __(), _e(), _ex(), log_e()).

= How do I install UpdraftPlus? =

Here are the installation guidelines from our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ReY7Z19h2I">YouTube channel</a> or from <a href="https://updraftplus.com/download/">our website</a>.

= Where are your other FAQs, other than the few found here? =

Here: <a href="https://updraftplus.com/faqs/">https://updraftplus.com/faqs/</a> (by keeping them in one place, we make sure they don't fall out-of-date!).

= Is there any way to make managing multiple website backups easier? =

Yes! We’ve developed a brilliant new plugin that allows you to backup, update and manage all of your website remotely from one central location. It’s called UpdraftCentral, and it comes in 2 different forms:

* UpdraftCentral (free, self-hosted)
* UpdraftCentral Premium (fully-hosted by us and "ready-to-go"; self-hosted version also available)

= What if I have a problem / need support ? =

You can find us in <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/updraftplus">the WordPress support forum for this plugin</a>. However, before you get in touch with problems, please do ensure that you read through all the FAQs and that you’ve updated to the latest release of our plugin. If you’re a paying customer, you should <a href="https://updraftplus.com/support/">go to our support page, here.</a>

It helps greatly if you can include the backup log and as much other information as possible in your report, for example, the PHP version, your website, the error description, how you got to the page that caused it, any other relevant plugins you have installed, plus any other information that might be of use.

To find the backup log: there are links to download the logs on the UpdraftPlus settings page- or you may be emailed it. Failing that, FTP into the directory wp-content/updraft and look for it there.

If you know how, please send your PHP error logs- just the few lines that appear when you run a backup, often the file called error_log, possibly in your wp-admin directory which you can check via FTP. And if you’re a programmer that can debug and send a patch, that’s even better.

= UpdraftPlus runs out of time when it’s trying to backup, after I have left it for some time to give it a good chance. What can I do? =

This problem is probably caused by your account being starved of resources by your (cheap) web host provider. This is far from ideal; although UpdraftPlus supports resuming backup runs right from the beginning to avoid everything having to be done at once, it has its limits. The best thing is to choose a more reputable web host. Failing this, try going into the “Expert settings” and reducing the size at which zip files are split. UpdraftPlus is known to successfully backup websites that run into the multiple-gigabytes on web servers that are not resource-starved.

= If my site gets hacked and the backups don’t work, is there anything I can do? =

Unfortunately not; since this is free software, there’s no warranty and no guarantee. It’s up to you to verify that UpdraftPlus is creating your backups correctly.

* FEATURE: Backup destinations with conditional logic rules for scheduled backups (Premium)
* FIX: A regression in 1.16.30 meant that the term_relationships table could have rows missing in the backup if mysqldump was not present/used; this meant that items with multiple terms were only having one relationship backed up (e.g. multiple tags being assigned to one post)

* TWEAK: Rename UpdraftCentral's main and listener classes

* TWEAK: Integrate UpdraftPlus and WordPress 5.5 core's automatic update settings

* TWEAK: Add downloadable backup links in the Backup Report email (Reporting Addon)
* TWEAK: Rename some classes in our fork of the Google SDK to prevent conflicts
* TWEAK: Improve automatic backups output when 'UPDRAFTPLUS_NOAUTOBACKUPS' constant is defined.
* TWEAK: Remove the now-redundant concept of inner loops from the database table backup routine

= 1.16.31 - 20/Oct/2020 =

* FIX: A regression in 1.16.30 meant that tables with integer primary keys which used signed integers omitted the first row of the table from the backups. This is not common (e.g. it does not affect any core WP tables; most plugins adding tables follow WP core in using unsigned integers for primary keys).

= 1.16.30 - 15/Oct/2020 =

* PERFORMANCE: Where a table has a numerical primary key, extract its data using that index. This results in a substantial performance increase when fetching large tables using PHP. (The filter updraftplus_can_use_primary_key_default can be used to de-activate this behaviour).

* TWEAK: Catch errors from Google Cloud when the bucket is not found
* TWEAK: Fix undefined variables instead of expected values in message prior to settings import

* TWEAK: Show a notification of UpdraftPlus plugin updates even if the associated user account is not connected to the UpdraftPlus website
* TWEAK: Add mechanism to detect what hosting provider is being used and use it to make UpdraftPlus comply with Kinsta's backup limit policies (thus removing it from the list of disallowed plugins)
* TWEAK: When booting a clone if it's claimed from the clone queue then update the token being used
* TWEAK: Tweaked downwards the minimum time in the future for rescheduling a resumption

* TWEAK: When testing SFTP settings, if debug is activated, activate debug logging and pass the results back in the event of test failure
* TWEAK: Optimise away a database query in the case of no UpdraftCentral keys existing
* TWEAK: Removed "Reduced Redundancy" storage class from Amazon S3 remote storage options, because Amazon are deprecating it (and it now costs more, for inferior redundancy - https://updraftplus.com/forums/topic/amazon-is-phasing-out-reduced-redundancy-storage/)
* TWEAK: Backup files missing error message corrected
* TWEAK: Add the handlebars-js and xamin/handlebars.php libraries
* TWEAK: The FTP storage module has been ported to outputing its configuration via a template
* TWEAK: Introduce internal API and port all job data saved in storage modules to be instance-local

= 1.13.5 - 08/Aug/2017 =

* TWEAK: Manage phpseclib through composer
* TWEAK: Do less logging to database when resuming and noticing already-processed tables (saves resources)
* TWEAK: Returns comment status when updating comments from UpdraftCentral
* TWEAK: Update plugin-updates-checker library to current (4.2), and manage via composer, replacing bundled copy in the build source
* TWEAK: Replace uses of create_function(), which is deprecated on PHP 7.2
* TWEAK: Replace deprecated constructors (PHP 7+) in webdav module
* TWEAK: Documentation showing plugin developers how easy it is to add in-page backups to their plugin: https://updraftplus.com/add-take-backup-functionality-plugin/
* TWEAK: Make the UpdraftCentral updates checking able to cope with a wider range of third-party schemes
* TWEAK: General code tidy-up, making older code conform to our current standards
* TWEAK: Minor version updates of some bundled libraries
* TWEAK: Produce and use minified resources (CSS/JS) where available
* TWEAK: Update class-udrpc to latest (1.4.14) which removes a conflict with other code that may interact with CORS OPTIONS requests
* TWEAK: Escape log lines when sending for display (theoretically an XSS security issue, but to achieve a successful attack, someone would have to first get something malicious into the log file, which is difficult as there are not many places where foreign input can end up in the log file - e.g. hack into Dropbox and cause Dropbox to send you back malicious HTML in an error message - and then be able to persuade you to both take a backup triggering the problem and then view the log file in your WP dashboard)
* TWEAK: Update Google Cloud bucket locations

= 1.13.4 - 08/Jun/2017 =

* FIX: Import function had a regression and was not coping with all formats
* TWEAK: When the import function failed, the error was not shown to the user

= 1.13.3 - 07/Jun/2017 =

* FIX: Revert Dropbox authentication change in 1.13.2, which was not working on all sites

= 1.13.2 - 07/Jun/2017 =

* TWEAK: Marked as tested and compatible on WordPress 4.8
* TWEAK: Dropbox authentication flow can now use POST for the final step, side-stepping (arbitrary) parameter length restrictions on some Apache mod_security setups
* TWEAK: Prevent a possible PHP notice when curl is not present
* TWEAK: Point Clef users towards Keyy
* TWEAK: Do not open an alert box when the user changes their site ID in 'Advanced Tools'
* TWEAK: Fix parameters to updraft_check_overduecrons() JS function

= 1.13.1 - 09/May/2017 =

* REFACTOR: Completed re-factoring of the remote storage modules, so that now all remote storage code has completed this current stage of re-factoring (more to come in future - laying the foundation for a significant new feature)
* FIX: Added a nonce to the Dropbox deauth link. This is a minor security issue - someone personally targetting you, who knew that you were logged in to your WordPress admin, and who could persuade you to visit a personally-crafted web page, could cause the connection between UpdraftPlus and your Dropbox to be broken. The only impact of this is that the sending of your next backup to Dropbox would fail, and you would be alerted about the need to re-connect.
* FIX: Import settings now handle the new remote storage options format
* FIX: The zip file browser was not working in free versions
* TWEAK: Added a version check when saving settings to prevent errors or lost settings
* TWEAK: 'Existing Backups' table now shows an icon for each remote destination that the backup was sent to
* TWEAK: Update SSL CA certificates file
* TWEAK: If, when uploading to S3, a file is not found, handle it slightly more elegantly
* TWEAK: Work with some WebDAV servers that previously sent empty responses to OPTIONS requests

= 1.12.40 - 01/Apr/2017 =

* TWEAK: The in-page log file display had stopped continuously updating in 1.12.32
* FIX: In some circumstances, settings for the storage modules refactored in 1.12.37 could fail to show
* FIX: The free version of 1.12.37/38 in some circumstances could fail to complete Dropbox authentication

= 1.12.38 - 31/Mar/2017 =

* TWEAK: Dropbox API v2 call to de-authorise a token was failing
* FIX: Prevent a fatal error when attempting to use a backup method with no options set

= 1.12.37 - 31/Mar/2017 =

* FEATURE: Browse the contents of a backup from within your WordPress dashboard, and (with Premium) download individual files from it
* FIX: Fix an issue that could occasionally cause corruption of interrupted Dropbox backups. All Dropbox users are recommended to update asap.
* TWEAK: Remove debugging statement inadvertently left in 1.12.36
* TWEAK: Re-factored remote storage handlers via add-ons so that there was a cleaner and more consistent class hierarchy (preparation for future improvements). N.B. If you subsequently downgrade to an older version of UpdraftPlus, you will need to re-enter the settings for some remote storage options.
* TWEAK: List of checksum algorithms run over backups and logged now includes SHA256, and is filterable (SHA1 now considered deprecated)
* TWEAK: Allow chunked database encryption to try and resume in the event of an error
* TWEAK: Improve the premium/extension tab content
* TWEAK: Fix an issue whereby the UpdraftVault settings section could show a bogus problem with checking quota immediately after initial setup
* TWEAK: When requesting a download, work around buggy browser/server that continued after Connection: close
* TWEAK: Improve the UI experience when downloading a log file for display fails
* TWEAK: Prevent PHP notice if another plugin cancels a cron event
* TWEAK: Tweak semaphore handling and enhance logging
